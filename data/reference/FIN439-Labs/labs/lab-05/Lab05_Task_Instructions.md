## Today's run of show

1. Workspace
2. **D** question
3. **R** inputs
4. **I** build; **quiz when told**
5. **V** known answer
6. **Reflect**; **Reversed DCF**
7. Checkout - GitHub

[Lab 05](https://github.com/CinderZhang/FIN43900-Fall2026/blob/main/lessons/week-03/lab-05-dcf-build.md)

## Workspace alive

1. **VS Code -> File -> Open Folder** -> your Course/Work Folder. Trust the authors: **Yes**.
2. **Terminal -> New Terminal.**
3. `python --version`. **Expect:** `Python 3.1x`. Windows `py`, macOS `python3`.

**AI partner:** **Google Antigravity** extension (Extensions -> search -> Install -> sign in), or any AI in a tab.

## D - the question, the same for everyone

> **What is one share of your company worth on a five-year FCFF DCF - and what growth does today's price already assume?**

Paste it into your Lab 04 chat.

---

## R - the five inputs

| Input | Training value | What it is |
|---|---:|---|
| Starting FCFF | 100 USD millions | last year's FCFF |
| Growth, Years 1-5 | 8%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3% | a stated fade |
| WACC | 10% | discount rate - never copy it |
| Terminal growth | 3% | after Year 5; below WACC |
| Cash / debt / shares | 50 / 300 / 50 | business to one share |

Source nothing today.

## I - build from the instruction

1. Right-click your folder -> **New File** -> `dcf.py`.
2. Send this, then read the next slide:

   > Write one Python file, `dcf.py`, using only Python's standard library - no packages to install. At the top, a block of inputs I can edit by hand: starting FCFF in USD millions; five yearly growth rates; WACC; terminal growth; non-operating cash; debt; diluted shares in millions. Fill them with these training values: FCFF 100; growth 0.08, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03; WACC 0.10; terminal growth 0.03; cash 50; debt 300; shares 50. Convention: annual end-of-year FCFF, five explicit years, a Gordon-growth terminal value at the end of Year 5 discounted five years, then equity value = enterprise value + cash - debt, divided by diluted shares. Stop with a clear message if terminal growth is greater than or equal to WACC. Compute every number from the inputs - never type an answer in - and print twelve labelled lines to four decimals: FCFF for Years 1 to 5; present value of the five explicit FCFF; terminal value at Year 5; present value of the terminal value; enterprise value; equity value; value per diluted share; and the present value of the terminal value as a share of enterprise value. I have the known answers and will check every line. Then give me the exact command to run it, and explain in two sentences why the terminal value is discounted five years and not six.

3. Paste only the code into `dcf.py`, save.
4. `python dcf.py`. **Expect:** twelve labelled lines; debug until clean.

## V - prove it on the known answer

| Output | Known answer |
|---|---:|
| FCFF Year 1 | 108.0000 |
| FCFF Year 2 | 114.4800 |
| FCFF Year 3 | 120.2040 |
| FCFF Year 4 | 125.0122 |
| FCFF Year 5 | 128.7625 |
| PV of explicit FCFF | 448.4408 |
| Terminal value, Year 5 | 1,894.6486 |
| PV of terminal value | 1,176.4277 |
| Enterprise value | 1,624.8685 |
| Equity value | 1,374.8685 |
| Value per share | **27.4974** |
| PV of TV / enterprise value | **0.7240** (72.40%) |

All twelve within a cent, or debug with your AI. Classic error: six-year terminal discount.

**Prove it:** WACC `0.11`, save, rerun. **Expect:** about **23.41**. Back to `0.10` - Thursday's first prediction.

## Reflect - Reversed DCF

**Explain to your partner:**

1. The coding logic.
2. How WACC moves the value.

**Evolve:** skip in class.

**Learn on your own:**

1. What is Reversed DCF?
2. How does it work?
3. Explain it.

## Checkout - on GitHub

**Brightspace -> Quizzes -> Lab 05.**

**GitHub links of your files: md, py and/or other files as needed.**

**Thursday:** your company through this model in reality - DCF valuation, Reversed DCF, and a grid that shows how fragile the number is.

## How this connects to my Palantir work

For my FIN439 Palantir research, this lab turns the prior company research into a model-building task. Earlier labs established the company, source trail, watch-defer investment call, and the need for stronger valuation discipline. Lab 05 should produce the Python DCF model first using the training values, prove it against the known answer, and then prepare to apply the same framework to Palantir in the next class.

The important discipline is that every number should be computed from editable inputs. The training model does not need external sources today, but the later Palantir version will need real FCFF, growth, WACC, terminal growth, cash, debt, and diluted share inputs tied back to the research packet.
